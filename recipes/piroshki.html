    <h2>A Russian Family Favorite</h2>
    <p>A classic piroshki is a savory Russian pastry made from a soft, yeasted dough and filled with a variety of ingredients. Traditionally, it features a flavorful filling of seasoned meat (like beef or pork), onions, and sometimes mushrooms or rice. The dough is usually slightly sweet and tender, creating a perfect balance with the savory filling. Piroshki are typically baked until golden brown, offering a delightful, warm bite that is both hearty and comforting.</p>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p><em>Prepare the Dough:</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm milk with a pinch of sugar. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, until frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the remaining sugar, melted butter, egg, and salt. Add the yeast mixture and mix well.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the flour, mixing until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1-1.5 hours, until doubled in size.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Prepare the Filling:</em></p>
    <ol start="6">
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions and cook until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the ground meat and cook until browned. Drain excess fat if necessary.</li>
        <li>Stir in the mushrooms (if using), salt, pepper, and paprika. Cook for another 5 minutes, then let the mixture cool.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Assemble the Piroshki:</em></p>
    <ol start="10">
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Punch down the dough and divide it into 12-16 equal pieces.</li>
        <li>Roll each piece into a small circle, about 4 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each circle.</li>
        <li>Fold the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape, pinching the edges to seal.</li>
        <li>Place the piroshki on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush each with a beaten egg for a golden finish.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Bake:</em></p>
    <ol start="17">
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Cool and Serve:</em></p>
    <ol start="18">
        <li>Let the piroshki cool slightly before serving. Enjoy warm or at room temperature!</li>
    </ol>
