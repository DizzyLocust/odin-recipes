    <div class="ingredients">
        <h3 class="title">Ingredients</h3>
        <p><em>For the Pastry Crust:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold and cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>3-4 tablespoons ice water</li>
        </ul>
  

        <p><em>For the Filling:</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>6 slices of bacon</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Gruyère or Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped (optional)</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        </ul>
    </div>    
    <h3 class="title">Instructions</h3>
    <p><em>Making the Pastry Crust:</em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Add the cold butter cubes and cut them into the flour using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Gradually add ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, flatten it into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface to fit a 9-inch pie pan. Transfer the dough to the pie pan, trim any excess, and crimp the edges. Prick the bottom with a fork.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Pre-baking the Crust:</em></p>
    <ol start="4">
        <li>Line the crust with parchment paper and fill it with pie weights or dried beans. Bake for 15 minutes, then remove the weights and parchment and bake for an additional 5 minutes until the crust is lightly golden. Let it cool slightly.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Preparing the Filling:</em></p>
    <ol start="5">
        <li>Cook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until crisp. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and cool, then crumble.</li>
        <li>If using onions, cook them in the bacon fat until softened and golden. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the crumbled bacon, cooked onions (if using), and grated cheese evenly over the bottom of the pre-baked crust.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>Assembling and Baking the Quiche:</em></p>
    <ol start="8">
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, salt, pepper, and nutmeg until well combined. Pour the egg mixture over the bacon and cheese in the crust.</li>
        <li>Bake the quiche in the preheated oven for 35-40 minutes, or until the custard is set and the top is lightly browned. The quiche should be slightly puffed and firm in the center.</li>
        <li>Allow the quiche to cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Allow the quiche to cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing. This helps the custard set properly and makes slicing easier. Serve your Quiche Lorraine warm or at room temperature, accompanied by a fresh green salad or a light soup. Whether you're enjoying it for brunch, lunch, or dinner, this classic French dish is sure to delight your taste buds with its rich, savory flavors and creamy texture. Bon appétit!</p>
