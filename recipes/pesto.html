    <h1>Basil Pesto</h1>
    <img src="../images/pesto.jpg" alt="pesto" height="500">
    <h2>Good with practically everything!</h2>
    <p>Classic basil pesto is a vibrant and aromatic Italian sauce made primarily from fresh basil leaves, pine nuts, garlic, Parmesan cheese, and extra virgin olive oil. The ingredients are traditionally ground together using a mortar and pestle, but modern recipes often use a food processor for convenience. The result is a bright green, smooth, and slightly chunky sauce with a rich, nutty flavor and a hint of garlic. It’s perfect for tossing with pasta, spreading on sandwiches, or using as a dip. The key to a delicious pesto is using high-quality, fresh ingredients.</p>
