# odin-recipes
This project is a basic website and an exercise in building and reinforcing skills learned thus far from "The Odin Project" curriculum.

This includes:

Setting up a git repository to maintain and host work related files.<br>
Updating files using git from the command line.<br>
Creating an organized file system containing html files and other resources for the website.<br>
Writing and formatting html files to build website in a way that's consistent with the goals of the project guidelines.<br>
Writing descriptive commits before pushing to git repo.

This will all be done with the continued intention of building good habits that will make my time spent on "The Odin Project" worthwhile in becoming valuable and employable in web development or other related fields.
